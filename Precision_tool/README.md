# Precision, Recall, and Accuracy Script
## Overview:
This code judges the overall precision, recall, and accuracy of the FishSense YOLO model's output. The script computes stats for a given dataset on the number of fish that the model detects as well as whether any fish are detected at all in an image. The script serves as a way to filter out images that don't have fish and focus on the files that do.
